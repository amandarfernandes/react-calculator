# REACT CALCULATOR APP
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Introduction
You can visit the deployed app, at https://amandarfernandes.github.io/react-calculator/.

This repository contains the files related to the app. The master branch contains the app's source code (the code the app's developers edit), and the gh-pages branch contains a built version of the app (i.e. the code that GitHub Pages serves to the app's visitors).
